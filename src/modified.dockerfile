# Build a container image based on a prepackaged application pulled from an Azure Artifacts feed (private PyPI)

# We use a multi-stage build to keep artifact feed secrets out of the final image
# If we did not, we would be able to retrieve the secret in plain text by running `docker history`

FROM python:3.7-alpine AS builder

# We'll pass in the credentials for pip as a Docker --build-arg

# Copy our application wheel(s) from dist
COPY dist /dist


# Set the PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable for this command, which is used by pip to search for packages
# We want to update pip itself, as to not accidentally log the password during build (requires pip 19.0+)
# We also choose gunicorn as our wsgi host - it's not explicitly defined as a dependency in setup.py
# We install everything with the --user flag, which places packages into ~/.local
